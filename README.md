# Momentum Bicycle Workshop  
![Momentum](documentation/screenshots/momentum.png)  

Momentum Bicycle Workshop is a web application designed to streamline bicycle repair bookings, manage appointments, and provide a seamless experience for customers and workshop owners.  

This project is my fourth milestone project for the **Code Institute Full Stack Developer course**.  

 **Live Demo**: [Click here](https://momentum-bicycle-workshop-22fb69372d3e.herokuapp.com/contact/) to visit the deployed version.

##  Purpose  

Momentum Bicycle Workshop is an independent, small-scale bicycle repair business. Unlike large franchises, it focuses on **personalized service**, **community engagement**, and **a passion for cycling**.  

The website serves as a **digital hub** where users can:  
- Schedule repair appointments.  
- Manage their bookings.  
- Contact the shop for inquiries.  
- Stay informed about services and pricing.

##  Requirement Gathering & Planning  

Before developing this project, I analyzed existing bicycle repair websites to identify common patterns and market gaps. Some references included:  
- [Bicycle Workshop](https://bicycle-workshop.de/about)  
- [Velovezh](https://velovezh.ch/)  
- [Imboden Bike](https://www.imboden-bike.ch/en/workshop)  
- [Aureus Drive](https://aureusdrive.ch/en/about-us/blog/)  

 **Key Insights:**  
- Many small bike shops lack an online presence.  
- Larger businesses have complex, feature-rich websites, but smaller shops need **simple yet effective solutions**.  
- There‚Äôs an opportunity for a **clean, user-friendly booking system** for local workshops.  

This vision shaped my design and development choices.

##  Technologies Used  

### **Languages**  
- Python  
- HTML  
- CSS  

### **Frameworks, Libraries & Tools**  
1. **Django** ‚Äì Backend framework for handling logic.  
2. **Bootstrap** ‚Äì Frontend styling and responsiveness.  
3. **GitHub** ‚Äì Version control & repository hosting.  
4. **GitHub‚Äôs Code Editor** ‚Äì For writing and running the code.

##  Data Model  

The web app follows **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations**, ensuring smooth appointment management.  

### **Authentication & Validation**  
 Secure login for **customers**, **shop owners**, and **admin users**.  
 Restriction of **appointment bookings** to available dates/times.  
 Validation for **cancellation policies** to prevent misuse.  

**ERD**
![Navigation bar](documentation/screenshots/erd.png)

The database is structured using Django‚Äôs ORM, which maps Python classes to database tables.

**Key Entities:**
- User ‚Äì Represents customers and shop owners.
- Appointment ‚Äì Stores booking details (date, time, service description, status).
- Service ‚Äì Different types of repair services offered.
- Workshop Owner ‚Äì Special permissions to manage appointments

**Relationships:**

- A User can book one Appointment at the time (One-to-One).
- Each Appointment is linked to a specific Service (Many-to-One).
- A Workshop Owner can manage multiple Appointments.
- The Django authentication system handles user authentication and permissions.

This relational structure ensures data integrity, prevents duplicate bookings, and allows efficient scheduling.
