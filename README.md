# Momentum Bicycle Workshop  
![Momentum](documentation/screenshots/momentum.png)  

Momentum Bicycle Workshop is a web application designed to streamline bicycle repair bookings, manage appointments, and provide a seamless experience for customers and workshop owners.  

This project is my fourth milestone project for the **Code Institute Full Stack Developer course**.  

 **Live Demo**: [Click here](https://momentum-bicycle-workshop-22fb69372d3e.herokuapp.com/contact/) to visit the deployed version.

##  Purpose  

Momentum Bicycle Workshop is an independent, small-scale bicycle repair business. Unlike large franchises, it focuses on **personalized service**, **community engagement**, and **a passion for cycling**.  

The website serves as a **digital hub** where users can:  
- Schedule repair appointments.  
- Manage their bookings.  
- Contact the shop for inquiries.  
- Stay informed about services and pricing.  

---
##  Requirement Gathering & Planning  

Before developing this project, I analyzed existing bicycle repair websites to identify common patterns and market gaps. Some references included:  
- [Bicycle Workshop](https://bicycle-workshop.de/about)  
- [Velovezh](https://velovezh.ch/)  
- [Imboden Bike](https://www.imboden-bike.ch/en/workshop)  
- [Aureus Drive](https://aureusdrive.ch/en/about-us/blog/)  

 **Key Insights:**  
- Many small bike shops lack an online presence.  
- Larger businesses have complex, feature-rich websites, but smaller shops need **simple yet effective solutions**.  
- There‚Äôs an opportunity for a **clean, user-friendly booking system** for local workshops.  

This vision shaped my design and development choices.

##  Technologies Used  

### **Languages**  
- Python  
- HTML  
- CSS  

### **Frameworks, Libraries & Tools**  
1. **Django** ‚Äì Backend framework for handling logic.  
2. **Bootstrap** ‚Äì Frontend styling and responsiveness.  
3. **GitHub** ‚Äì Version control & repository hosting.  
4. **GitHub‚Äôs Code Editor** ‚Äì For writing and running the code.

##  Data Model  

The web app follows **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations**, ensuring smooth appointment management.  

### **Authentication & Validation**  
 Secure login for **customers**, **shop owners**, and **admin users**.  
 Restriction of **appointment bookings** to available dates/times.  
 Validation for **cancellation policies** to prevent misuse.  

**ERD**
![Navigation bar](documentation/screenshots/erd.png)

The database is structured using Django‚Äôs ORM, which maps Python classes to database tables.

**Key Entities:**
- User ‚Äì Represents customers and shop owners.
- Appointment ‚Äì Stores booking details (date, time, service description, status).
- Service ‚Äì Different types of repair services offered.
- Workshop Owner ‚Äì Special permissions to manage appointments

**Relationships:**

- A User can book one Appointment at the time (One-to-One).
- Each Appointment is linked to a specific Service (Many-to-One).
- A Workshop Owner can manage multiple Appointments.
- The Django authentication system handles user authentication and permissions.

This relational structure ensures data integrity, prevents duplicate bookings, and allows efficient scheduling.

##  Future Enhancements  

 Planned features for future releases:

 **Improving Lighthouse rating**  
 **Calendar-based booking system** (Instead of dropdown lists).

 **Interactive Map** (For shop location).  
 **Forgotten password recovery system**.

##  Testing

**Automated Testing**

I implemented automated unit tests using Python's unittest module (or pytest, if used). 
These tests ensure that key functions work correctly without manual intervention.

    Example of Automated Tests:

- Test Appointment Booking ‚Äì Ensures users can book appointments with valid inputs.
- Test Appointment Cancellation ‚Äì Verifies that only authorized users can cancel an appointment.
- Test User Authentication ‚Äì Checks if login/logout functionality works as expected.
- Test Home page load.

![Tests](documentation/screenshots/tests.png)



**Manual Testing**


I used a **test-as-you-go approach**, ensuring each change worked correctly before moving forward. 


Tested each user journey from start to finish.
Validated form inputs with valid/invalid data.
Checked authentication and authorization flows.
Ensured responsiveness across different browsers and devices.

**Lighthouse Accesibility Testing**

Unfortunately the lighthouse test gave confilcting results in different stages of the project.
Weirdly early in to the project the scores were consitentley high and the final product is scoring low.
I ran the lighthouse test on mobile, desktop version in incognito mode, after clearing cache etc. it didn't make
any difference. The cause and the solution is still to be investigated.

### **Testing Checklist:**  
 End-to-end testing for all user journeys.  
 Validation of all form inputs (empty fields, incorrect values).  
 Browser compatibility testing on **Chrome, Safari, and Firefox**.  
 

### **Validation Results:**  
 **HTML Validation**

 ![html](documentation/screenshots/htmlvalidation2.png)   
 **CSS Validation**

 ![css](documentation/screenshots/cssvalidation2.png)  

 **Flake8 Validation**  

 The Flake8 validation returned a long list of errors in the code. The list was full of E501 error messages.
 Majority of the error originates from the code of the libraries as it turned out.

 ![501](documentation/screenshots/validationerrore501.png)

 There were also errors in the cutom code, those ones have been reformatted, but that process had impact on some of the functions.
